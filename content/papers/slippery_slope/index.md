##### Abstract

Slippery slope arguments — the idea that otherwise beneficial reforms should be re-
jected lest they beget further undesirable one — are ubiquitous in political discourse.
We provide a learning-based policy-feedback mechanism to explain why slippery slope
dynamics arise. Additionally, we provide conditions under which, in equilibrium, so-
phisticated agents will successfully manipulate policy to either induce or prevent a
slippery slope dynamic.
