## Motivation

I like to write my notes in courses in LaTeX, and to review I often go through the entire course and clean them up. After I've used them for exams, I'll post them here, for anyone to use. 

## Ownership

All of the material in these notes is the property of the professors who taught the courses, and I claim no ownership of it. I do feel as if I've sufficiently modified and contributed to be able to share them, but if any professors object, please let me know and I'll be happy to remove them (or put them in a private repository).

## Other Material

I've included more complete course materials in the [private](/resources/private) section of this website. If you are interested in accessing them, and are a Cornell student,[^1] please [email me](mailto:gs754@cornell.edu) and I can get you a password.

[^1]: Or a SIEPR predoc, or a Stanford student, or a friend of a friend, etc. I'm not trying to be particularly restrictive, but these materials are not meant to be public.
