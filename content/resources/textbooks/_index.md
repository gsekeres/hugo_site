## Economics

##### Core Microeconomics

Use [MWG](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/microeconomic-theory-9780195073409?cc=us&lang=en&). If MWG is too complicated, use [Varian](https://wwnorton.com/books/Microeconomic-Analysis) and then once you understand Varian, use MWG.

##### Game Theory

I got a lot from [Osborne and Rubinstein](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262650403/a-course-in-game-theory/). I've heard there are mixed opinions, but I read it cover to cover.

##### Mechanism Design

[BÃ¶rgers](https://academic.oup.com/book/2244) is extremely good.

##### Econometrics

I'm using a combination of [Hansen](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691235899/econometrics) and [Casella and Berger](https://www.routledge.com/Statistical-Inference/Casella-Berger/p/book/9781032593036). For background, I'm using the Blitzstein notes (see below). I've previously taken [Stefan Wager's](https://web.stanford.edu/~swager/stats361.pdf) course, and those notes are invaluable.

##### Macroeconomics

I'm mostly using [Stokey, Lucas, and Prescott](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674750968), along with [Ljungqvist and Sargent](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262038669/recursive-macroeconomic-theory/). For coding, there's no better resource than [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/).

## Mathematics

##### Analysis

[Johnsonbaugh and Pfaffenberger](https://store.doverpublications.com/products/9780486477664?srsltid=AfmBOorFb4OiJiAFEqwqvA4-L0SsvZwsSinm-ZkiYVgPrPlXv5hKGRy6) is, in my opinion, brilliant. By pacing, it assumes some prior knowledge, but otherwise is entirely self-contained.

##### Linear Algebra

[Strang](https://math.mit.edu/linearalgebra/). Also watch his [lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK3O402wf1c).

##### Probability

Joe Blitzstein's [undergraduate](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home) and [graduate](https://www.ekzhang.com/assets/pdf/Stat_210_Notes.pdf) notes are fabulous, and saved my life many times.

##### Convex Optimization

[Boyd and Vandenberghe](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/). Also, if you're at Stanford, take the course with Boyd. Take it as soon as possible. It's so good.
