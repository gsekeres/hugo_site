## CV

My CV is available [as a downloadable PDF](/cv/gabe_sekeres_cv.pdf), and the source code is available [on Github](https://github.com/gsekeres/hugo_site/tree/main/static/cv). Here it is embedded for your convenience:

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 100%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
    <iframe src="/cv/gabe_sekeres_cv.pdf" 
            style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;">
    </iframe>
</div>

I stole and modified a template from [Zahra Thabet](https://zahrathabet.com/), to whom I am very grateful[^1]. I modified the template to compile correctly in [Texifier](https://www.texifier.com/) using [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/) (TeX Live 2024 with kpathsea version 6.4.0). This involved downloading specific icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and converting them to png files -- a better coder can probably figure out how to get the package fontawesome5 to work in Texifier, but I couldn't figure it out.



[^1]: I'm fairly sure that Zahra stole it from somewhere else, but she denies this. Make of this what you will.
