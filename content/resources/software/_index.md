I've stolen a lot from my friend [Zahra Thabet](https://zahrathabet.com/). She has a ton of great resources on her website, use them.

##### IDE

Everything I write is in [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/). It's 2024, it's time to accept LLMs into our life. Also it makes me like 80% faster at coding. I've found myself using Claude Opus more than Chat GPT, it tends to be better at executing my ideas quickly and accurately, while I've found Chat GPT to be better at ideation in general.

##### Hugo

I use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to build this website. I stole the vast majority of the code from [Pascal Michaillat](https://pascalmichaillat.org/) who has spent a lot of time making economists' lives easier.

##### LaTeX

I use [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), and I write it in [Texifier](https://www.texifier.com/). This is the main place I've found that Cursor fails -- the autocomplete is more annoying than helpful. For shared projects, I use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) with Dropbox integration.

##### Obsidian

I store and organize all of my notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vaults.

##### Git

I use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to manage all of my code. I use [GitHub](https://github.com/) to host my code. My git username is `gsekeres`. I will be posting all of the code from my first year coursework on there -- see [notes](/resources/notes/) for more details.

##### Julia

I do the vast majority of my coding in [Julia](https://julialang.org/). My first year macroeconomics coursework is in Matlab, which I find deeply annoying. I'm currently doing the problem sets in tandem, in both Julia and Matlab (another reason why Cursor is great). Everyone should use Julia, though.
