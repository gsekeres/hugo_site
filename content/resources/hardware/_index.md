##### Computer

MacBook Pro 14", 2021, M1 Pro. Simple as.

##### Keyboard

Currently using a [Logi wave](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/wave-keys-mac.920-012402.html) keyboard. It's solid, but I'll be replacing it with a [Microsoft Sculpt](https://www.incase.com/pages/incase-designed-by-microsoft) once Incase actually allows me to buy one.

##### Mouse

[Logitech MX Master 3](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-master-3.910-005647.html). It's the best for a reason.

##### Monitor

I use the cheapest ones I could find.
