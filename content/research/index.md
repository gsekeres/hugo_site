## Broadly Thinking About:

The intersections of micro theory, econometric theory, and machine learning.

How do researchers act? How do they learn? How do they make decisions? What changes when researchers are algorithms?

## Specifically Working On:

People have presented a number of suggestions for solving the replication crisis. These suggestions sometimes do not take into account dynamics; and they almost always do not examine the effects on innovation. [Nic Fishman](https://njw.fish/) and I are thinking about this.

Multiple papers with [Eric Sun](https://profiles.stanford.edu/eric-sun), my predoctoral mentor, on the effects of surgeons (and anesthesiologists) taking leaves on patient outcomes. Updates on this coming soon.
