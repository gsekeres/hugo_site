My research spans microeconomic theory, political economy, and the economics of science.

## Mechanism Design and Algorithmic Game Theory

I study the behavior of no-regret learning algorithms in strategic environments, particularly pricing games. This includes investigating whether algorithmic pricing leads to supracompetitive outcomes and distinguishing between collusion and misspecification in learning dynamics.

I have derived necessary and sufficient conditions for extensive-form coarse correlated equilibria to be equivalent to Nash equilibria, with ongoing work extending these results to normal-form games.

## Political Economy

In collaboration with [Marco Battaglini](https://www.mbattaglini.com/) and [Tom Palfrey](https://www.hss.caltech.edu/people/thomas-r-palfrey), I study group-based voting models and collective decision-making, applying structural methods to traditional political economy voting models. My work on policy dynamics with [Giri Parameswaran](https://sites.google.com/site/gaborparameswaran) examines how policy momentum and learning shape political outcomes, including when sophisticated agents can manipulate policy to induce or prevent slippery slope dynamics.

## Science of Science

Joint work with [Nic Fishman](https://njw.fish) studies how journals should design acceptance rules when testing is cheap and p-hacking is a concern. When researchers can run many specification searches at low cost, traditional screening based on p-values breaks down. We show that journals can harness the same sequential search that enables p-hacking by requiring robustness checks: if the underlying effect is real, cheap testing makes it easy to produce many corroborating results, while false positives cannot consistently replicate across specifications.
