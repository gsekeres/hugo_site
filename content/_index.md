I'm a second year PhD student at Cornell University, focusing on microeconomic theory and computer science. Before Cornell, I majored in Economics and Mathematics at Haverford College, and was a predoctoral research fellow at Stanford University, where I worked with [Laurence Baker](https://healthpolicy.fsi.stanford.edu/people/laurence_c_baker) and [Eric Sun](https://profiles.stanford.edu/eric-sun). My full CV is [here](/static/gabe_sekeres_cv.pdf).

Currently, I'm thinking about mechanism design and its interactions with algorithmic game theory, an area I feel is underexplored from the Economics side. I'm also working with [Marco Battaglini](https://www.mbattaglini.com/) on group-based voting models, more specifics to come. I'm always thinking about science of science, and the decision problmes that researchers face. If any of this sounds vaguely interesting, reach out! I'm always happy to chat.
